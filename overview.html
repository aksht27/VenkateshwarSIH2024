            <p class="text-xl text-gray-700">
                Water footprint is a comprehensive measure of freshwater use that looks at both direct and indirect water use of a consumer or producer. It includes the water used throughout the supply chain, as well as during the use of the product.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report consistently lists water crises among the highest impact global risks. Until now, water has been treated as a free raw material. Today, companies are starting to realize that mismanagement of water can damage their brand, their credibility, their credit rating, and their insurance costs.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Unless you know how much water you are using – and how much is available in the river basins in which you and your suppliers operate – it is impossible to know whether you are using it sustainably or whether your business could face water-related business risk.
